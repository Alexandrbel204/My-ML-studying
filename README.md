This is the final result of my theoretical preparing for ML interview. I have done a lot of work to look for these materials, collecting them, learning, learning and learning again. This actually took around 2 years to finally get into materials I searched but the final state was made at the summer 2025.
First of all, I want to thank all the people who helped me doing this or just supported and studied along with me. Especially Alim (whose files you can find inside)
During my studing process I divided the materials into several sub files:
  * Supervised
  * Unsupervised
  * Ensembles
  * Feature Engineering
  * Model Evaluation
  * A/B tests and statistics
  * ML System Design (just slight basics)
